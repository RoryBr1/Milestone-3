# User Stories

Each of the user stories was used as a starting point to test each of the features on the site, and ensure that they are accessible and work correctly.
These were tested on both mobile and desktop resolutions.

1. **As a _site administrator_, I want to upload recipes to the site for the _end-user_ to view. I want to be able to edit and delete these recipes if needed.**
    
        âœ”  Once logged in (see #3), the _Add New Recipe_ button appears.

        âœ”  The button directs the user to the relevant page, where an intuitive form allows them to add a new recipe.

        âœ”  Once the form is submitted, a confirmation flash message appears, and the recipe is successfully added to the site.

        âœ”  _Edit_ and _Delete_ buttons are visible overlaying the image of each recipe.

        âœ”  The _Edit_ button directs the user to the relevant page where they can easily edit the properties of the recipe.

        âœ”  The _Delete_ button opens a model which asks for confirmation to delete the recipe. Once confirmed, the recipe is deleted, and a success flash message appears.

2. **As a _site administrator_, I want to sort the recipes into separate categories for ease of browsing. I want to be able to rename or delete these categories, and add new categories in future.**

        âœ”  Once logged in as admin, the _Manage Categories_ button appears.

        âœ”  The button redirects the admin to the relevant page, where the _Add Category_ function is clearly visible, as well as _Rename_ and _Delete_ buttons for each existing category.

        âœ”  The _Add Category_ form works correctly and displays a success message.

        âœ”  The _Rename_ button opens a modal window which allows the user to rename the category; this works correctly and displays a confirmation message thereafter.

        âœ”  The _Delete_ button opens a modal which asks for confirmation to delete the category. Once confirmed, the category is deleted, and a success message appears.

3. **As a _site administrator_, I want to ensure that only I can alter the content of the website.**

        âœ”

4. **As an _end-user_, I want to browse recipes relevant to me; including searching through them using search terms, or view only Breakfast recipes.**

5. **As an _end-user_, I want to share a good recipe I found on the site with my friends on social media.**
