## Overview

JunkFood Vegan is a data-centric web project build as part of the [CodeInstitute](http://www.codeinstitute.net/) Full-Stack Software Development Course. 
It is a dynamic recipe website built with two users in mind; the end user, and the site administrator.
The end user can browse, view and share recipes. The site administrator - once authenticated - can add, edit, delete and categorize recipes using an intuitive web interface.

The website is fully responsive, utilizing simple and colourful design language and an intuitive information structure.
